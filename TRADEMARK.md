# Trademark and Branding Guidelines

## Overview

"FishTankController", associated logos, and related branding elements are trademarks of Scott McLelsie. While the FishTankController software is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (which grants broad permissions for the code itself), trademark law provides additional protections for the project's name and branding.

## What This Means

The Apache License 2.0 grants you permission to use, modify, and distribute the FishTankController software. However, **Section 6 of the Apache License explicitly states that the license does NOT grant permission to use trademarks**.

You may:
- Use the software for any purpose
- Modify and distribute the software
- Reference "FishTankController" when describing the origin of your derivative work

You may NOT:
- Use the "FishTankController" name or logos in ways that imply official endorsement or affiliation
- Create products or services using the "FishTankController" name that could cause confusion with the original project
- Use the trademarks in domain names, product names, or app store listings without permission

## Guidelines for Forks and Derivatives

If you create a fork or derivative of FishTankController:

### Required Changes

1. **Rename your project** - Choose a distinct name that clearly differentiates your work
2. **Change the default hostname** - The default device hostname (`aquarium.local` or similar) should be changed
3. **Modify branding in the UI** - Update the web interface header, page titles, and any visible branding
4. **Update app/product names** - If distributing as an app or product, use your own name

### Attribution

You MUST provide proper attribution per the Apache License 2.0:
- Include a copy of the LICENSE file
- Retain copyright notices
- Include a NOTICE file stating the software is based on FishTankController
- You may add: "Based on FishTankController by Scott McLelsie" in your documentation

### Acceptable References

You MAY truthfully reference FishTankController:
- "Forked from FishTankController"
- "Based on FishTankController"
- "Compatible with FishTankController"
- In technical documentation describing the origin

You may NOT imply official status:
- ❌ "Official FishTankController"
- ❌ "FishTankController Pro"
- ❌ "FishTankController by [YourCompany]"

## Commercial Use and Resale

See [COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md) for detailed guidance on commercial use, including:
- Installation and configuration services (allowed)
- Preloading hardware (allowed with attribution)
- Standalone product sales (trademark restrictions apply)

## Contact for Permission

## Rationale

These trademark guidelines exist to:
1. Prevent user confusion about the source and support of different versions
2. Protect the reputation and quality associated with the FishTankController name
3. Ensure users can identify the official project
4. Allow the project maintainer to control the brand's direction

These restrictions are standard practice for open source projects and are separate from the code license.

## Summary

**Code**: Apache License 2.0 - freely use, modify, distribute
**Name/Branding**: Trademark protection - use your own name for derivatives
**Attribution**: Required - give credit to the original project
