# Commercial Use and Business Guidance

## The Goal: "Let It Spread, But Don't Clone and Compete"

FishTankController is licensed under Apache License 2.0, which **permits commercial use**. This document clarifies what that means in practice and outlines community expectations for commercial activities.

## What the Apache License Allows

The Apache License 2.0 grants you the legal right to:
- Use the software commercially without paying royalties
- Modify the software for commercial purposes
- Distribute the software as part of commercial products or services
- Sell products or services that incorporate this software

**Important**: These are legal permissions. The guidelines below are community expectations that complement (not override) the license.

The following commercial uses are **explicitly encouraged and welcome**:

### Professional Installation and Configuration
- Charging for installation services at homes, businesses, or aquarium shops

## ⚠️ Discouraged Activities (Trademark and Branding Considerations)

While legally permitted under Apache 2.0, the following activities conflict with trademark rights and community expectations:

### Standalone Product Resale Using Original Branding
- **Scenario**: Taking the unmodified or minimally modified software, packaging it as your own product, and selling it as "FishTankController" or a confusingly similar name
- **Issue**: Creates user confusion about the source, support, and official nature of the product
- **Guidance**: If you want to sell FishTankController as a standalone product, consider:
  - Contacting the project maintainer about becoming an official partner/reseller
  - Creating a distinct fork with your own branding (see [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md))
  - Ensuring you add significant value (support, warranty, custom hardware, etc.)

### Competing Products with Original Branding
- **Scenario**: Creating a competing commercial aquarium controller product that uses "FishTankController" branding without permission
- **Issue**: Violates trademark rights (separate from code license)
- **Guidance**: You're free to build competing products using the code, but use your own branding

- Selling FishTankController as your primary product
